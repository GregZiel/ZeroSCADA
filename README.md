# ZeroSCADA
A written-from-scratch, open-source SCADA system project

This project is created to verify whether today's technology allows building single-handedly a fully-fledged, fully operational software system with complexity level characteristic to industrial or banking systems.
The goal is to make it as complete as possible - with documentation, analysis, descriptions, everything.
Of course it also means that it will address real customers' needs and be production-ready.
